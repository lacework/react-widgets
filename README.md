Lacework fork of react-widgets@3.4.5
=============

# Releasing
This could be a single script in package.json, but I figured being explicit is better to catch issues. And we will 
probably never release another version.

Build for production
```
npm run build
```

Bump the version number. This uses the preid format so we have an obvious link to the source docs and code if neede
```
npm version prerelease --preid fork.<next version here> --no-git-tag-version
```

Publish 
```
npm publish --access public --tag latest
```

__Demos and Documentation [here](http://jquense.github.io/react-widgets/docs/)__

### Install

`npm install react-widgets`

### Building local docs

The docs are a simple React app hosted on gh-pages, you build and run locally with the command `npm run docs` and open up `http://localhost:8080/docs/index.htm#/`

### Contributing

Patches welcome! Please try to match the style of the repo (comma first, 2 spaces, etc), squash large pull requests (a few commits is fine), and provide tests if relevant. It is also a good idea to open an issue and start a conversation before implementing new features or widgets.

### Old Browser Support

The goal is to support IE8+, but currently it is difficult for me to test a wide variety of browsers so there is no guarantee it will work (patches welcome!).
